# Squid-s-A-Mazing-Rooms
Immersive Gaming Experience built with Unity

I love to play maze games as it is challenging to find the means of passing through and escaping. 
**Squid's A-Mazing Rooms** was an immersive gaming experience built with Unity, it is an implementation of WebVR experience gaming design. 
Inspired by one of the iconic scenes in Squid Game, my goal in this project is to build a complex multi storeys maze with a combination of corridors, doors, and up and down stairs.
There is one avatar in the game. Players would be able to control movement of the avatar, by moving forward, and walking stairs up and down.
Multiple cameras will be created. First camera will enable first person view and by following player’s movement; second camera will be enabled for providing a God’s perspective.

I built the game with Unity Hub, scripted with UnityEngine, explored how to apply Collider and Cinemachine in my game.

## **_Features_** 
✔️Player could move forward, and walk stairs up and down <br>
✔️Player could turn around for 360 view of where he/she stands <br>
✔️Camera 1 for first person view and follow player’s movement <br>
✔️Camera 2 for overall environment view <br>

## **_Lesson Learnt_** 
✔️Various functions in Unity <br>
✔️Build my own prefab for different parts of the maze <br>
✔️How to build a 4D maze game with Unity by duplicating objects and moving along different dimensions <br>
✔️Apply vector functions in controlling movement of the avatar, since my characters will move forward, turn around and walk up and down stairs <br>
✔️How to create cameras with various viewpoints for immersive experience. The maze will evoke tension, stress, hopelessness when try to reach the top of the maze. In VR the colors, scale, and complexities of the modeled mazed will envelope the user for a game against yourself or try not to get lost<br>
